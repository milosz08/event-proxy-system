[[About project](https://miloszgilga.pl/project/event-proxy-system)]

Event proxy system receiving events from a fake SMTP server (on the local network), parsing them and
sending them via real-time communication channels (SSE). It also includes a simple REST client with
CRUD operations and desktop application receiving these events from multiple proxy servers.

## Basic concept

The core concept involves a fully isolated local network (e.g., 192.168.X.X) containing a mock SMTP
proxy server that receives events from internal devices, such as a DVR. Data from this server is
stored in a database and delivered to clients via a secure Cloudflare tunnel, which removes the need
for risky port forwarding. Furthermore, messages are End-to-End encrypted, ensuring that no one, not
even Cloudflare's edge servers, can decrypt the content.
